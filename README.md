# Email_spam_classifier

**Introduction**

  
   A machine learning–based email spam detection system built using TF-IDF text vectorization and the CatBoost classifier. This project classifies emails as Spam or Ham by learning patterns from labeled text data. It includes robust file handling, label encoding, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.This model is designed to handle real-world datasets with inconsistent formats and supports efficient text processing for reliable spam detection. This project demonstrates practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning for email security and filtering systems.
   CatBoost is a highly effective machine learning algorithm for email spam detection, consistently outperforming many other models due to its robust handling of categorical features and its use of symmetric decision trees to prevent overfitting
